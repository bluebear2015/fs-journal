# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These four pillars provide the foundation for writing maintainable and scalable code |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > |export default is used to export a single value as the default export, while export with named exports is used to export multiple values as named exports.|

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > |Encapsulation is one of the core concepts in object-oriented programming and describes the bundling of data and methods operating on this data into one unit. |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | It helps you create another object on behalf of the original object. This new proxy object will act as a mediator between the real world and the original object |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | A class is a type of blueprint that you can use to make objects. A concrete 'thing' that you constructed using a certain class is an object, which is an instance of a class. So, while the terms 'object' and 'instance' are interchangeable, the term 'instance' refers to an object's relationship to its class. |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > |Computed properties are provided by classes, structures, and enumerations. Stored properties are provided only by classes and structures. |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | it is a template for keeping a website more responsive and more reactive.
   MVC is primarily used to separate an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | draws data to the dom |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | the service layer handles all the buisness logic for the app |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | it is  a blurprint of how we want the data displayed in out app|
