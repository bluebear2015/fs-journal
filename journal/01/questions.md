# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    
    > we use git to push code to a third party source as a form of source control.

    > it used to make a new folder or directory.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    
    > a pseudo class alows you to target specific things inside of an element. 

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    
    > it is being verbose with naming conventions so when going back to reference or make changes on the code, you can find specific functions quickly.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    
    > setting something as !important makes it have precident over other functions which could be problematic.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```
     
     > selector, property, and value.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    > easy to follow designs with good user interface.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

    >  it is giving a simple stucture to apps that are made, from prototype to appliaction.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

    > yes. when it comes to the overall organization of the whole project, wireframing is nessesary.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`

    > flex allow the layout of a section to run horizontal instead of vertical.
