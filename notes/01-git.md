-----------------------------BOOTSTRAP 08/09---------------------------
bootstrap is a framework that helps you build websites faster by using prebuilt components.
Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.
we can break up the web page into a grid using columns and rows using bootstrap custom classes.
bootstrap has custom text and background colors.
using container-fluid makes it so when the application is scrolled or compressed it moves fluidly with screen size and doesnt break or overflow.
column are broken into 12, but you don't need to fill all 12, although it could cause problems for larger applications.
make sure to have a row element before you add a column element in order to make a successful grid.
always style your "hero-image" in css not bootstrap.
Bootstrap does have its benefits for quick small styling and WireFrame work but CSS allows for more customizable styling.
you can filter and change the hue of an image or logo in the CSS file.
Start using Anchor Tags more!
in order to arrang things by media scrren size we can use bootstrap order- 1-5 and with that we can put md-order 1-5
to switch the order arrangement when the screen size changes.
